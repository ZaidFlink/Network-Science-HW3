# GCN Implementation Progress

## Current Status
- Implemented basic GCN model for Cora dataset
- Running multiple experiments (10 runs)
- Current performance:
  - Test Accuracy: 34.93% ± 2.06%
  - Test F1 Score: 32.03% ± 1.64%
  - (Far below paper's reported 81.5% accuracy)

## Identified Issues
1. **Severe Performance Gap**
   - Large gap between validation (70%) and test (35%) accuracy
   - Training accuracy reaches ~97% indicating severe overfitting
   - Model fails to generalize despite good validation performance

2. **Training Dynamics**
   - Early convergence to suboptimal solutions
   - Unstable learning process with high variance between runs
   - Current learning rate and scheduler may be suboptimal

3. **Architecture Issues**
   - Current skip connections might be too aggressive (0.2 weight)
   - Dropout strategy (0.7 for first layer) might be too strong
   - Graph convolution may not be capturing neighborhood information effectively

## Next Steps
1. **Architecture Improvements**
   - Revisit skip connection implementation
   - Adjust dropout rates (try 0.5 for both layers)
   - Consider adding residual connections between layers

2. **Training Optimizations**
   - Implement proper weight initialization
   - Fine-tune learning rate and scheduler
   - Add proper regularization techniques

3. **Data Processing**
   - Review adjacency matrix normalization
   - Investigate feature preprocessing
   - Consider adding feature augmentation

4. **Validation Strategy**
   - Implement k-fold cross validation
   - Add model ensemble techniques
   - Better early stopping criteria

## Target Metrics
- Aim to achieve accuracy closer to paper's reported 81.5%
- Reduce gap between validation and test performance
- Improve stability across different runs
