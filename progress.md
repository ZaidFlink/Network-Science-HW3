# Node Classification Task Progress Tracker

## Project Overview
Compare performance of multiple node classification algorithms on citation network datasets, following the GCN paper's train/test split methodology.

## Datasets to Process
- [ ] Citeseer
- [ ] Cora
- [ ] PubMed

## Required Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- [ ] Download and load datasets
  - [ ] Citeseer dataset
  - [ ] Cora dataset
  - [ ] PubMed dataset
- [ ] Implement train/test split following GCN paper
  - [ ] 20 nodes per class for training
  - [ ] 500 nodes for validation
  - [ ] 1000 nodes for testing

### 2. Algorithm Implementation
Need to implement at least 2 node classification algorithms:
- [ ] Algorithm 1 (e.g., GCN)
  - [ ] Implementation
  - [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Validation
- [ ] Algorithm 2 (e.g., GraphSAGE)
  - [ ] Implementation
  - [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Validation

### 3. Experimental Setup
- [ ] Set up 10-fold cross-validation framework
- [ ] Implement performance metrics
  - [ ] Accuracy
  - [ ] Standard deviation
- [ ] Create logging mechanism for results

### 4. Experiments to Run
For each dataset (Citeseer, Cora, PubMed):
- [ ] Run Algorithm 1
  - [ ] 10 runs
  - [ ] Calculate average performance
  - [ ] Calculate variance
- [ ] Run Algorithm 2
  - [ ] 10 runs
  - [ ] Calculate average performance
  - [ ] Calculate variance

### 5. Results Analysis
- [ ] Compile results into tables/graphs
- [ ] Calculate and report:
  - [ ] Average accuracy for each algorithm on each dataset
  - [ ] Variance across 10 runs
  - [ ] Statistical significance tests (if applicable)

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Document methodology
- [ ] Document implementation details
- [ ] Create results summary
- [ ] Write conclusions and comparisons

## Technical Requirements
- Python environment setup
- Required libraries:
  - [ ] PyTorch/TensorFlow
  - [ ] NetworkX
  - [ ] NumPy
  - [ ] Scikit-learn
  - [ ] Pandas

## Notes
- Follow GCN paper split methodology
- Can choose to use or ignore feature matrices depending on algorithm
- Need to ensure reproducibility of results
- Must maintain consistent train/test splits across algorithms for fair comparison
